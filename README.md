Mini Language Translator (ML)
Overview

The Mini Language Translator is a machine learning tool designed to translate text between English and a selected regional language such as Hindi, Tamil, Telugu, or Marathi. The project demonstrates the use of sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) models or pretrained transformer models for language translation. It is suitable for educational purposes and small-scale translation tasks.

Features

Translate text between English and a regional language (bidirectional).

Uses a small dataset of 30–50 sentence pairs for training.

Implements seq2seq models or utilizes Hugging Face pretrained models.

Provides a simple interface for testing translations.

Technology Stack
